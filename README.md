This project is a random assortment of string/number lists that I've collected over the years. I've found them useful in various projects, so I've decided to share them. static_lists is built using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), [Astro](https://astro.build), [clsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx) and the [React](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/react) and [Tailwind](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/tailwind) integrations from Astro. Any changes made are automatically deployed via netlify.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| `pnpm w dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`        |
| `pnpm w build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`            |

## Contributing

If you would like to create a new list simply add a new json file to the data directory. The file must take the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "...", // Required
  "description": "...", // Optional
  "values": ["...", "...", "..."] // Required
}
```
